* Primo

[[http://knowledge.exlibrisgroup.com/Primo][Primo]] is the search interface that is used by default with the alma interface.

There is a [[https://ucdavis-primosb.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo_library/libweb/action/search.do?vid=01UCD_V1][UCD Sandbox]] for our primo instance, but this points to the production
version of the UCD Alma instance.  There is an additional  [[https://ucdavis-primosb.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com:1443/primo_publishing/admin/action/menus.do][Alma Administration Sandbox]]



* Alma

Alma has a number of [[https://developers.exlibrisgroup.com/alma/apis][APIs]] that can be used in their application.
